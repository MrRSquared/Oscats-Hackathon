# Welcome to the Inaugural Oscats Hackathon

The purpose of these challenges are to help teach an aspect of programming to anyone with either a physical or virtual robot. Each of these tutorials will assume software is either installed on your machine (If you are using the team's computers, it should be.).

The options:

## 1) FRC Robots

a) The full-sized robot (or base) <- Language: Java, Python, or CPP
b) The Romi mini bot<- Java or CPP

## 2) Non-FRC Mini Bots

a) The Maqueen Plus <- Language: Makecode, Block, Javascript, or Python

This is a solid mini bot able to teach you all you need to know about the concepts involved in programming the full-sized robot.

b) Zumo Robot <- Language: CPP (Arduino)

Create a fighting robot, and conquer your opponent all while learning the concepts to program an FRC Robot.

c) The Finch <- Block, Python, Javascript, Java

We are trying this out. It has all of the sensors and tutorials to learn each programming concept to control a robot.

Regardless of platform, if you make it through this hackathon, you will earn supreme bragging rights, a customized button, and special stickers. You will also learn the following concepts...

- Make a robot move
- Make it stop after a certain time (Dead Rekconing)
- Make it stop after a specific distance (using an encoder)
- Turn to reach a target
- Use a line sensor
- Use a rangefinder
- Turn to an angle

## Bonus Challenges

- Learn and implement PID
- Use a camera for tracking an object (or going to a target)

## Non-robot related Challenges

- Make a Google Site
- Learn a programming language
  - Java, Python, Javascript, CPP
- Git Capture the Flag
