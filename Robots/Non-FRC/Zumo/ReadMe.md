Here are the official Pololu Docs for the [Zumo.](https://pololu.github.io/zumo-32u4-arduino-library/)

[This repo](https://github.com/pvcraven/zumo_32u4_examples) has a lot of excellent tutorial examples, but there are many in the Arduino Studio as well. For each of these tutorials, there is a video like this one.

Visit their [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Professor+Craven+zumo) to see them all.

[This](https://github.com/BrandeisMakerLab/Robotics_ZumoAutomation/) is a nice add-on for the Zumo. It could enable Zumo Tournaments.
