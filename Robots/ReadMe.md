## Level Two

### Dead Reckoning

**Whew, you made it. Your robot has just been teleported to the game field. You will need to mark up the field as we go forward.**

**Speaking of going forward, you see the aliens right behind your bot. You need to go through the next portal before they get to you. However, there is a catch. You can see the entrance to a labyrinth dead ahead. If you hit the wall in front of you, you will trigger a not so well hidden trap.**

Make your field resemble the diagram below.

Drive your robot 3 lengths forward, but make sure it stops before it hits the wall in front of it. Use a timer to control when the robot stops.
